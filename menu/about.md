Hello, my name is Damian and I am a M.Sc student, currently based in Munich, Germany. After completing my degree in the field of mechanical engineering I have decided to expand my area of interests to machine learning, data science and AI. 
This website is designed to be my personal testing grounds for various projects, assignments, observations and reflexions.
